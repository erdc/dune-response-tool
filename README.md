# dune-response-tool

This is an experimental product for the rapid simulation of coastal foredune evolution during storms funded by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Coastal Inlets Research Program (CIRP).
The tool is meant to automatically develop boundary conditions and run simple dune erosion and acccretion models.
The tool includes dune profile erosion based on Palmsten and Holman (2012) and wind blown transport proceses predicted by Kawamura (1951) and Delgado-Fernandez (2011).
Databases of beach and dune morphology are included for model setup and the tool automatically interfaces with web services to access wind, wave, and tide data for both hindcast and forecast datasets.
